# Twitter VR Demo
This project is aimed to create a virtual representation of a VR app with a 3D interface to challenge the method of interaction and search in a Virtual environment.

There are two variations of the same project released:

1. A desktop app environment
2. A virtual app environment

Please keep in mind that I am strictly a developer and not a graphic designer. If you would like to contribute to the looks and feel of this environment please send me a P.M. and possibly I could proceed with graphics and looks improvement for this project.

## Introduction
In the world which is filled with data and user related information, we sometimes wonder what are the possibilities beyond what we see and collect from surroundings. In a virtual world, we have the opportunity to demonstrate a possibility, showing, manipulating and effectively representing knowledge in a virtual spectrum.

While virtualization is a very heavy task, the power of representation of data, on the other hand, is very challenging. To be able to perceive data one may attempt to tag, create virtual charts, and tables, or create virtual relations between objects to represent connections. This in terms needs a reliable method of creating a U.I. which is (1) intuitive, (2) interactive, and (3) extendible.

A user interface, or U.I., is not limited to just visualization of data, but also the method of interaction in virtual reality. One may engage in a Homer selection methodology to interact with objects, and one may use point and fly to engage users to move around. Furthermore, displaying simple data and notifications is necessary to have within this virtual world.

As such, I have taken the opportunity to create a simple demonstration of how a twitter engaged world would necessarily look like, what would be the interacting elements, and furthermore, what are the possibilities and further development options.

## Why a Twitter App
Twitter is a fast-growing social media application with a public API and features that one can use to simply find references to recent tweets and topics. However, the goal of this project is to focus on the usability of an application beyond a 2D screen space and challenge the use of interactive gestures and movements to engage the audience within a virtual social media platform.

Twitter is simple enough for the purposes of this project to demonstrate complex interaction and generation of the environment to create a challenging virtual world.

## Why a Virtual App
In many ways, our interactions have been limited to a standard 2D interface where we collect information by scrolling and expanding feed on our cellphones or PCs. This project aims to seek ways to manipulate daily interactions and seek methods to engage the audience in more of a realistic searching world. 

One needs to look around at statues, and move around to seek them at the moment. However, with more expansion of the API one can simply generate a fully live environment where users can find feed connections and progression of immersion into the social area.

## Technicalities of Interaction
In this project, I have aimed to use the simplest method of interaction which is understandable for users, engaging, and powerful enough for further development - Ray Casting. The strength of ray casting can be demonstrated in two ways. (1) Users are lazy in general and do not want to move around and touch
