# Twitter VR Demo
This project is aimed to create a virtual representation of a VR app with 3D interface to challenge the method of interaction and search in a Virtual environment.

There are two variations of the same project released:

1. A desktop app environment
2. A virtual app environment

Please keep in mind that I am strictly a developer and not a graphic designer. If you would like to contribute to the looks and feel of this environment please send me a P.M. and possibly I could proceed with graphics and looks improvement for this project.

## Why a Twitter App
Twitter is a fast growing social media application with a public API and features that one can use to simply find references to recent tweets and topics. However, the goal of this project is to focus on usability of an application beyond a 2D screen space and challenge the use of interactive gestures and movements to engage audience within a virtual social media platform.
